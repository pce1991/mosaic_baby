@BUG: no sound?? 
@BUG: why are some of the background sprites not index 0?
@BUG: why does the color not get reset after it's been hit? 
@BUG: clicking on space spawns crater on center of moon

Rendering:
Want masks for the tiles
Want instanced sprite rendering I think as a core mosaic feature
I want to be able to draw multiple quads over the same tile which will make using this much more powerful: https://mrmotarius.itch.io/paint-tiles. 

@TODO: 
for coverage on cells we could draw a big tile which covers the whole area

@TODO: pass in an A and B color and lerp between them instead of always scaling to black

@TODO: I actually really like the overlapping tiles thing, but I think I want to choose what a depth order so there's more control

@TODO: SetTileSprite which takes an integer I think 
@TODO: instead of LoadSprite we can have an internal AddSprite or something which adds to a pool and we use the SetTileSprite(pos, index) to draw from this pool
@TODO: would be nice to use a hashtable too tho

@TODO: get a regular square mask and use that for the default rendering
- this definitely kills simplicity a bit...


@BUG: why do we have mem corruption in moonlight? setting the tile color overwrites our audio data? 
- when we call SetGridSize we do a memset and that doesn't touch it all
- somethin to do with tileStates seems more likely
- LoadSoundClip is changing things inside our state dynamic array??? wtf are we not pushing data correctly onto our PL scene?
